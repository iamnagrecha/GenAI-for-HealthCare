can a single LLM help diff healt care needs

Yes, by fine tuning the model

- can generate realistic medical images
- summarize key reasearch
- can help, identify data patterns, indicating inefficiences.

Need to fine tune the base model, including reasearch papers, clinical notes

Quality of i/p prompt- determines quality of o/p response.

3 menthods to shape model's response
1) zero shot prompting- no examples provided
1) one shot- giving single example
3) Few shot- given a few examples

The grounding problem (hallucinations)- can happen if LLM doesn't know outside of training data
